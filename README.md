## 🎯 What Is This?

`repository_audit_cli` is a **templated, Homebrew-installable Git audit CLI** that scans a single repo or a whole folder of repositories — then exports a Markdown, CSV, or JSON report you’ll actually want to read.

---

## 🧰 How to Use

```bash
brew install raymonepping/tap/repository-audit-cli
repository_audit
```

🧠 Philosophy
Born from a real mess of forgotten Git repos, repository_audit was built to make sense of chaos — without needing a dashboard, token, or setup. It’s:

🔍 Smart enough to know when a repo is stale

🧼 Clean enough to drop into CI/CD

💡 Flexible enough to make it your own (just edit the .tpl files)

⚡ Fast enough to feel native
